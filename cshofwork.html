            <h2>Chicago Sports Hall of Fame</h2>
            <p>The Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame is an institution that pays tributes to people in sports that made an impact on Chicago Sport Teams or was from Chicago and went on to have an incredible career. I was fortunate enough to work at Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame as an intern during the summer of 2021. My job was to create graphics of the hall of fame inductees and to manage their Twitter account. </p>

            <p id="cshof_video_text">Here is a short video I created for the Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame. This video was meant to serve as an outro or intro to CSHOF videos. This was made with replicating the CSHOF logo in Cinema 4D. I then took that 3D model and inserted in Adobe After Effects where I was able to add the spotlight that moves across the screen, revealing the logo. </p>

Zach Lavine was the first Chicago Bulls player to particpate in the Olympics since Jimmy Butler received the honor. Lavine went on to average <strong>9.7 PPG, 2 RPG, and 3.3 APG. </strong>
